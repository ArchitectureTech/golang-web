# Put A File

We put a file with code like this:

```go
func putFile(ctx context.Context, name string, rdr io.Reader) error {

	client, err := storage.NewClient(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer client.Close()

	writer := client.Bucket(gcsBucket).Object(name).NewWriter(ctx)

	io.Copy(writer, rdr)
	// check for errors on io.Copy in production code!
	return writer.Close()
}
```
